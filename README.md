# Refactoring-W1

## Description

My purpose of this work was to refactor the code to following semantic HTML standards. furthmore
it helps enchance accesiblilty and searchbility for screen readers.

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](./Assets/images/screenshot(193).png)
    ```
